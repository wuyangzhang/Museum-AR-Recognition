------------------MF NETWORK API-------------------------------- 

The libmfapi.so file is used as the MF network api library, it is the 32bit version. For installing it, simply enter:

	sudo mv libmfapi.so /usr/lib

If you use 64bit machine, please go http://mobilityfirst.orbit-lab.org/wiki/Proto/cModules/c0HostProtocolStack/b0Installation and see how to compile the src code and make install.

------------------MF STACK INSTALLATION AND RUN-----------------------------

Please go here http://mobilityfirst.orbit-lab.org/wiki/Proto/cModules/c0HostProtocolStack/b0Installation for intalling the MF stack on your own machine.

The hoststack_*.conf files are use for stack set up. To use them after you installed MF stack, for example:

	# run mfstack using a certain configure file
	sudo mfstack -e hoststack1.conf

	# if you want see more detail, run in the debug mode
	sudo mfstack -d hoststack1.conf

Keep in mind that some configurations are needed to be changed within this file for different machines and interfaces(say the default GUID, interface's name and address, etc.).

At last, you would need to run mfstack on both client side and server side if you want to use MF network.

------------------SET UP THE ACCESS POINT------------------------------

Some configure files used by sb5.node1-1 are already put in this folder actually, as the hostapd.conf, dnsmasq.conf and hostapd.

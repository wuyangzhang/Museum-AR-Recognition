This REPO is developed for the 2015 WINLAB SUMMER INTERN PROGRAM.

Project title: Real-Time Cyber Physical Systems Application on MobilityFirst

Introduction:

Most Cyber Physical Systems (​http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system) are characterized by stringent network requirements both in terms of latency (i.e. less than 100 msec response time) and scalability (i.e. Trillion-order scalability for CPS devices/objects ).

MobilityFirst, thorugh its name based Virtual Network Architecture used to provide Application Specific Routing to services and applications, can be exploited in the attempt of assisting these applications to meet their requirements.

The goal of the project is to implement a CPS Application based on computer vision (i.e. object recognition) that will be used in conjunction with MobilityFirst’s Virtual Network to showcase the benefits of the network service.

What has been done:

In the past few months, we've built up all the essential system, including the google glass and linux client program which is able to grab photos, Android application as a go between google glass and the MF server, CPS server main program using TCP or MF, OpenCV object recognition program, and also the cloud computing program based on STORM.

For how to configure/compile/install/use the whole system, please go see the README in each folder.

 Help for server-OpenCV application
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 The following parameters can be passed to this software:

 [-h | --help ]........: display this help
 [-v | --version ].....: display version information
 [-orbit]..............: run in orbit mode
 [-d]..................: debug mode, print more details
 [-m]..................: mine GUID, a.k.a src_GUID
 [-o]..................: other's GUID, a.k.a dst_GUID
 [-storm]..............: run in storm mode
 [-train]..............: train with the database
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 Please start the server first
 If you have not already train the Img database, use train option to train it
 Your need to be the root or use sudo to run the orbit mode
 Last, you should run the mfstack first before run this application in orbit mode
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 sample commands:
   # train with the database, create the yml file only
   ./server-OpenCV -train

   # start the server, run in debug mode
   ./server-OpenCV -d

   # start the server with STORM, all requests would be passed to storm framework
   ./server-OpenCV -storm

   # run in orbit mode, using MF network, set myGUID as 102, otherGUID as 101
   sudo ./server-OpenCV -orbit -m 102 -o 101
